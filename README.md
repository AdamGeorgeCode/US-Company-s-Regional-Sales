# US-Companys-Regional-Sales

Analysis and visualisation of regional sales data from a fictitious US company.

This project uses both SQL and Tableau to examine and visualize sales data from a fictious US company, with the aim of gaining key insights into the activity of the business. 

The Tableau workbook produced focuses on three categories;

•	Overall Profit Metrics

•	Profit By Product(s)

•	Profit By Geography

The dataset used is very detailed and there are additional visualisations that could have been created to further understand other aspects of the business’ activity if required.
